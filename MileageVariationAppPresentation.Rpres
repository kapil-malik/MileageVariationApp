Introduction

incremental:true

<small>Mileage Variation Application uses the mtcars dataset to analyze mileage variation with a predictor variable and an additional filter based on the transmission type (manual, automated, both). The following predictors are available in application -
* Number of cylinders (_cyl_)
* Gross horsepower (_hp_)
* Weight in lb/1000 (_wt_)
* Number of forward gears (_gear_)
* Number of carburetors (_carb_)

**About mtcars dataset** : 
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).</small>


Understanding mtcars dataset
========================================================
<small>
The mtcars dataset has `r nrow(mtcars)` entries with `r ncol(mtcars)` columns. The mileage (mpg) variation summary is as follows -
```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
summary(mtcars$mpg)
```
<br/><p>
The application helps user to analyze how the mileage varies, as an effect of predictors like weight, horsepower, gears etc. User can select from 5 such predictors.</p>
Further, there are `r sum(mtcars$am==0)` cars with automatic transmission, and `r sum(mtcars$am==1)` with manual. The application also allows for seeing the effect on one of these sub-sets [see example](#/SampleAnalysis).

Sample Analysis
========================================================
id: SampleAnalysis
<small>
Mileage variation with number of gears, filtered by automatic transmission -
```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
mtcars_automatic = mtcars[mtcars$am==0,]
qplot(mtcars_automatic$gear, 
      mtcars_automatic$mpg,
      xlab='gears',
      ylab="mpg",
      main="Automatic cars")+geom_smooth(method='lm')
```
***
Mileage variation with number of gears, filtered by manual transmission -
```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
mtcars_manual = mtcars[mtcars$am==1,]
qplot(mtcars_manual$gear, 
      mtcars_manual$mpg,
      xlab='gears',
      ylab="mpg",
      main="Manual cars")+geom_smooth(method='lm')
```
